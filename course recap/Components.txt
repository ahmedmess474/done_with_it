Fundamental Concepts 

we have many core components in react native (like html tags (div, span, img .....))

so in react-native or in mobile development we have 
1- View, 
2- Text,
3- Image,
4- Button, 
5- Touchables,
6- Alert 
and many others we are going to see them in this course. 


check all this component in reactnative.dev/docs

we have specific components for android and others for ios 
and we have the cross plateform components 

and we have a bunch of API's which gives us access to native functions 
they are not UI Widjets. For example we can use Keyboard API.

the Keyboard module allows us to listen for native events and react to them.

like the stylesheet function we saw earlier 

                    -------- Components ------------

1- Views: 
    is the most basic and Fundamental component in react native for building UI
    it's like a "div" in the mobile thing. we use it for grouping our elements. 

    always note that in ios devices there is that little bar above. 
    so he hide things. --------> Makes a problem. 

    that's when we use a special type of VIEW called "SAFE AREA VIEW" 

2- Text: 
    we use it for displaying Text we should always wrap our text in this component,
    this component have many props So let's take a look at this props: 
    numberOfLines, onPress(make it act like a link).

3- Images: 
    use it when we want to render an image 
    so to render an image we use the Image tag 
    then pass "source" as a prop 
    which takes in an object exp: 
    source={require("./assets/icon.png")},
    that's how for an existing image 
    but for a network image we download it like this 
        <Image
          source={{
            uri: 'https://reactnative.dev/docs/assets/p_cat2.png',
          }}
          style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }}
        />
    like the text component Image have too many props 

4- Touchables: 
    we can make anything touchable using this components : 
        1- Touchable Highlight,
        2- Touchable Opacity,
        3- Touchable without FeedBack
    this are the three cross plateform touchable components we have 
    in react native. 
    and there is "TouchableNativeFeedback" -------> ONLY ANDROID.

5- Buttons: 
    the value of the button we put it the "title" props 
    and each plateform represent the button with her own style
    and note that the button always self closing tag.

6- Alerts: 
    standard alert box let's see how we can do it 
    using the onPress on the button that we created using the alert function.
    but when we want to customize it we use the "Alert" API 
    it's not a component it's an API (object with a couple of methods)
    let's try it 
    we have two methods in this object: 
        1- alert: like the alert we have seen above.
            this one takes some parametres: 
                1- title,
                2- Message,
                3- Array of Buttons ----> 
                        each button is an object 
                        that takes in 3 properties
                            1- text,
                            2- style,
                            3- onPress --> function
        2- prompt: ask a question like the confirm in the web.
            does not work on android devices only on iphone.


****** Platform Specific Code *****
we use the platform module from react-native
