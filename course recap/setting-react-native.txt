so we use expo for our app 

Project structure 
assets: ----> that's where we put our images && files and videos ....  .

app.js: ---> basic react native component 
View is like a div in the web world 

in react native we dont have html elements 
we use the components from react-native. 

to Create the styles as a variables in react native 
so we declare a variable like this 

const styles = Stylesheet.create({
    container: {
        flex: 1,
        backgroundColor: #fff,
        ....
    }
}); 

os we use the Class Stylesheet.create and then we pass in an object 

Sso as a finish 
to start our app we use Expo server 

we open the terminal and we type npm start 

The simplest way to debug our react-native apps is using the good old 
console.log()  -------> statement

we can debug in chrome or in vs code both are normal

How to publish our app to expo to be visible to anyone in the world 

we can publish our app using metro bundler || or from the terminal 
using expo publish so let's try the publish command
